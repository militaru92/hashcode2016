# hashcode2016

This was our attempt at solving the Google Hashcode qualification round.
The problem was extremely interesting, but our approach was wrong.
We spent too much time thinking of a solution and we were left with too
little time to do the actual implementation.

It was very fun though and I'm looking forward to next year. Special thanks to
my collegues, it was fun!
